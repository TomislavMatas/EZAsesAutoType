# "EZAsesAutoType.csproj"
This project is used to build the assembly "EZAsesAutoType.exe".

A new version of the "EZSeleniumLib.dll" potentially has to 
be deployed with every major browser version update.
Resulting in a patch needed apx. every month on "Stable release" 
channels of Chrome and Edge.

The WebDriver version must be the same (or higher) 
than the browser verion installed.

Please refer to dedicated "EZSeleniumLib" project for details.
